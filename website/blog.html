                        <h2>The cryptocurrency is a digital Asset.</h2>
                         <p class="text">The process of crypto-currency generation and maintenance is not a simple job. To provide high security with customer ease is their priority. Since, there is not any centralized community to manipulate the entire functionality, Crypto uses an effective way to check the proper functioning of their system.

                            Crypto Mining<span class="moretext">
                            
                            The process of extracting new crypto coins using various cryptographic processes and then storing records on the blockchain is termed as crypto mining.
                            
                            Whenever any investment is done in crypto, the records are needed to be stored in the ledger which is known as Blockchain. However, the transaction is verified by the miners. After verifying, the data is stored in the blockchain with various encryption techniques and the transaction is complete.
                            
                            The verification requires a competition between various data miners. The crypto miners solve complex mathematical equations in high functioning computers. The miner who completes the task first is rewarded with some fraction of crypto. However, crypto mining is very costly. It requires high functioning computers with high electricity consumption.
                            
                            Proof-of-Work
                            
                            Proof-of-Work is a mechanism to safeguard the transactional records of many cryptocurrencies.
                            
                            However, the results generated by a data miner are needed to be verified by other data miners. The process of data mining is time consuming but the process of validating the results is quite simple. This process of verifying the results is termed as PoW, after which the data miner is given some part of crypto as a reward.</span></p>
